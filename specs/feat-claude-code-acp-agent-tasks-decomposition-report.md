# Task Decomposition Report: Claude Code ACP Agent for Zed Editor

**Generated**: 2025-08-29
**Source**: specs/feat-claude-code-acp-agent-tasks.md
**Task Management System**: STM (Simple Task Master)

## Executive Summary

Successfully decomposed the Claude Code ACP Agent specification into **16 actionable STM tasks** across 4 implementation phases. All tasks include complete implementation details, code examples, and acceptance criteria directly copied from the specification.

## Task Breakdown by Phase

### Phase 1: Core Protocol (6 tasks) ✅
- **[P1.1]** Initialize TypeScript Project Structure - Setup with dependencies
- **[P1.2]** Create Project Directory Structure - Module organization
- **[P1.3]** Implement JSON-RPC Connection Handler - ~400 lines
- **[P1.4]** Create Zod Schema Definitions - ~300 lines
- **[P1.5]** Implement Error Handling Framework - ~100 lines
- **[P1.6]** Create Base TypeScript Types - ~100 lines

### Phase 2: File Intelligence (2 tasks) ✅
- **[P2.1]** Implement Smart File Resolution - ~300 lines with glob fallback
- **[P2.2]** Create ACP Filesystem Proxy - ~100 lines for unsaved buffers

### Phase 3: Bridge Implementation (3 tasks) ✅
- **[P3.1]** Implement Main ACP Agent - ~300 lines protocol lifecycle
- **[P3.2]** Implement Session Management - ~400 lines stateful handling
- **[P3.3]** Implement Permission System - ~150 lines granular controls

### Phase 4: Polish and Integration (5 tasks) ✅
- **[P4.1]** Create Entry Point and CLI - ~50 lines executable
- **[P4.2]** Add Performance Optimizations - ~200 lines improvements
- **[P4.3]** Create Integration Tests - ~200 lines comprehensive testing
- **[P4.4]** Write Documentation - ~300 lines user/dev docs
- **[P4.5]** Package and Publish - ~100 lines npm distribution

## Implementation Strategy

### Critical Path
1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3/1.4 → 3.1 → 3.2 → 4.3 → 4.5

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Phase 1**: Tasks 1.3 and 1.4 can run in parallel
- **Phase 1**: Tasks 1.5 and 1.6 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Tasks 2.1 and 2.2 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3**: Tasks 3.2 and 3.3 can run in parallel after 3.1
- **Phase 4**: Tasks 4.1 and 4.2 can run in parallel
- **Phase 4**: Tasks 4.3 and 4.4 can run in parallel

## Code Distribution

**Total Estimated Lines**: ~2,200 lines of production code

- Phase 1: ~1,000 lines (45%)
- Phase 2: ~400 lines (18%)
- Phase 3: ~850 lines (39%)
- Phase 4: ~850 lines including tests and docs

## Key Implementation Details Preserved

✅ **Complete Code Examples**: All tasks include full implementation code from the specification
✅ **Technical Requirements**: Detailed technical specs for each component
✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Comprehensive test scenarios and validation points
✅ **Dependencies**: Clear task dependencies for proper sequencing
✅ **Zed Configuration**: Updated with latest agent_servers configuration format

## Risk Areas Identified

1. **JSON-RPC protocol complexity** (Task 1.3) - Requires careful message handling
2. **Claude SDK integration** (Task 3.2) - API compatibility and rate limiting
3. **Permission system edge cases** (Task 3.3) - User experience critical
4. **Performance requirements** (Task 4.2) - <100ms response time target

## Quality Assurance

Each task includes:
- Detailed implementation code (not references)
- Technical requirements and specifications
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Complete acceptance criteria
- Test scenarios and validation points

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 1**: Start with TypeScript setup and core protocol
2. **Review Dependencies**: Ensure all npm packages are available
3. **Set Up CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions early for continuous testing
4. **Test Integration**: Use Zed's `dev: open acp logs` for debugging

## STM Task Management

All tasks are now tracked in STM with:
- **Status**: All set to `pending`
- **Tags**: Phase, component type, priority, size
- **Dependencies**: Properly linked for execution order
- **Details**: Complete implementation code and specifications
- **Validation**: Comprehensive acceptance criteria

Use the following commands to manage tasks:
```bash
# View all tasks
stm list --pretty

# View specific task details
stm show [task-id]

# Start working on a task
stm update [task-id] --status in-progress

# Mark task complete
stm update [task-id] --status completed

# View tasks by phase
stm list --tag phase1
stm list --tag phase2
stm list --tag phase3
stm list --tag phase4
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 16/16 tasks created in STM
- ✅ All implementation details preserved
- ✅ No summary references ("as specified")
- ✅ Complete code blocks included
- ✅ Dependencies properly mapped
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities identified

## Conclusion

The Claude Code ACP Agent specification has been successfully decomposed into 16 executable tasks with all implementation details preserved. The tasks are organized in 4 phases with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Total implementation effort estimated at ~2,200 lines of production code plus tests and documentation.
